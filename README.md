from aqi_forecaster import run_analysis

df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv', parse_dates=['Timestamp'], index_col='Timestamp')
forecasts = run_analysis(df)
get_aqi_for_date(forecasts)
Command-Line Interaction
On running, the system will prompt for a date:

Air Quality Index (AQI) Forecasting System
A Python-based system for analyzing and forecasting air quality using time series decomposition and SARIMAX models. Includes both command-line and web-based (Streamlit) interfaces for pollutant-level forecasting, AQI categorization, and dominant pollutant identification.

Features
Forecasts AQI using historical pollutant data

Categorizes AQI according to EPA standards (Good to Hazardous)

Identifies dominant pollutants for each forecasted day

Handles missing data with forward fill and spline interpolation

Performs STL decomposition for trend and seasonality analysis

Implements SARIMAX models with automatic parameter tuning

Provides forecast evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics

Visualizes trends, decomposition components, and forecast outputs

Installation
Requirements
Python 3.7+

Packages: pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, streamlit, joblib

Install Dependencies
